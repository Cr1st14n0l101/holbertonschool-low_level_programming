##  C Functions

-   All the files has  been compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using  `gcc`, using the options  `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
-   I use the  `Betty`  style. It will be checked using  [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl "betty-style.pl")  and  [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl "betty-doc.pl")
-   There aren't more than 5 functions per file
-   The only C standard library functions used are  `malloc`,  `free`  and  `exit`. Any use of functions like  `printf`,  `puts`,  `calloc`,  `realloc`  etcâ€¦ is forbidden
-   All the header files are guarded.

## Special Thanks

*First of all we want to thank La Academia Holberton, who with their knowledge, resources and tools we have been able to carry out this project and each of its stages  to achieve the results we were looking for.
Thank you very much to all.*

- [Cristian Oliveros](https://github.com/Cr1st14n0l101): *Three months ago I didn't know anything about the C programming language, and today I feel like I can do a lot of things and I hope to continue learning a lot more with Holberton and have a promising future.*
